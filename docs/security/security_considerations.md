# Security Considerations

## Service Account Token Generation Permissions
ephemeral-iam is built around the idea that a user (User1) with the `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken`
permission bound to a service account (SA1) is able to generate OAuth 2.0 tokens for
that service account using the `projects.serviceAccounts.generateAccessToken` method.

When using the `eiam` CLI, OAuth 2.0 tokens are generated with reduced session
duration of 10 minutes and the tokens are never written to persistent storage;
however, ephemeral-iam does not attempt to stop users from using the
`projects.serviceAccounts.generateAccessToken` method outside of the context
of the `eiam` CLI. This means that any user could use the `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken`
permission granted to them to get an OAuth 2.0 session token by requesting
one directly from the GCP IAM Credentials API.

### Adding Observability
For the reason outlined above, it is a good idea to add some observability
mechanisms around the generation of service account tokens, and ephemeral-iam
provides some features to facilitate this. Any audit logs generated by requests
used within the context of the `eiam` CLI will include a `reason` attribute in the
`protoPayload.requestMetadata.requestAttributes.reason` field.  This field is
in the format `ephemeral-iam [a-f0-9]{16}: <USER_PROVIDED_REASON>`.

This can be leveraged to export audit logs and create alerts. An example Stackdriver
logging sink that exports all audit log entries generated by the `GenerateAccessToken`
method that do not have a properly formatted `reason` field is shown below.

**Log Export Filter:**
```
protoPayload.methodName="GenerateAccessToken"
AND protoPayload.requestMetadata.requestAttributes.reason !~ "ephemeral-iam [a-f0-9]{16}: .*"
```

These logs could be sent to a Cloud Pub/Sub to trigger alerts when someone
requests to generate a service account access token outside of the `eiam` CLI.
