# Getting Started Tutorial
This tutorial walks through how `eiam` can be used in a couple different situations.
It assumes that you have an existing GCP project and that you have sufficient
permissions to create the a few resources used throughout.

Before you begin, ensure that you have successfully installed the `eiam` CLI tool:
```
$ eiam version
INFO    ephemeral-iam vX.Y.Z
```
